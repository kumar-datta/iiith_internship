# Internship Assignment 1

-In this assignment, I used a YOLO model to perform object detection on an image.  
-The model was able to identify objects like bus and people, and displayed bounding boxes with confidence scores.  
-This confirms that the detection setup and environment are working correctly.  
-This completes my first task of the internship.

# Internship Assignment2 
- Performed object detection on multiple images.
- Also performed segmentation on the same images.
- Stored outputs in day2 folders.


# Internship Assignment 3

In this task, I used a video for object detection.
- I converted the video into image frames at 30 frames per second using FFmpeg, then processed all frames with the YOLO model to detect and segment objects.
- Finally, I combined the processed images back into a video at 30 fps.
- This helped me understand how to apply YOLO on video data and work with the complete frame-to-video workflow.
