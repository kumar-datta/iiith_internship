# Internship Assignment 1

-In this assignment, I used a YOLO model to perform object detection on an image.  
-The model was able to identify objects like bus and people, and displayed bounding boxes with confidence scores.  
-This confirms that the detection setup and environment are working correctly.  
-This completes my first task of the internship.

# Internship Assignment2 
- Performed object detection on multiple images.
- Also performed segmentation on the same images.
- Stored outputs in day2 folders.
